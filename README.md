### Chosen Final Project Topic

### Datasets: 
* *Nutrition Facts for Starbucks Menu* via [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/starbucks/starbucks-menu?resource=download), Uploaded to [GitHub](https://github.com/amywzhou/DH140/tree/main/starbucks%20data)
* *Nutrition Facts for McDonald's Menu* via [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mcdonalds/nutrition-facts), Uploaded to [GitHub](https://github.com/amywzhou/DH140/tree/main/mcdonalds%20data)

### Dataset Descriptions:
*Nutrition Facts for Starbucks Menu* includes the nutrution facts for items at Starbucks. 
*Nutrition Facts for McDonald's Menu* includes the nutrution facts for items at McDonalds.

### Motivation: 
To gain insight on the product naming process at Starbucks (and McDonalds, if time permits). To identify if deceitful marketing tactics are being used to convince consumers that items are healthier than they are. 

### Research Questions:
> What general connotation do the menu items have at Starbucks (and McDonalds), and how does the connotation compare to the item's nutritional value?

> What is the frequency of high frequency sounds and low frequency sounds in product names? How does it compare to its nutritional value for the most unhealthy products?

**After doing receiving inconclusive results in my intial analysis, I am considering switching my research questions to instead analyze how Starbucks and McDonalds differ in nutritional value. I am still exploring the datasets to see what other relationships I can examine.** 







## Potential Final Project Topics


### Research and Data Visualization of Interest
There are many areas of research that I find interesting. Below is an example of a topic that I would consider further exploring, as well as a an example of how I would like to present my findings.

*Journal:* [Music preferences as an instrument of emotional self-regulation along the business cycle](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10824-022-09454-7) 

This article appeals to me because it connects two seemingly unrelated topics together: the status of the economy and music preferences. By analyzing the datasets across time, connections that aren't obvious become apparent. I am particularly interested in the humanities topic of music trends since there are so many external factors that subconsciously impact our listening choices. 

*Data Visualization:* ![dataviz](https://cdnl.tblsft.com/sites/default/files/pages/7_pew_research_next_america.gif)

I like how the data visualization is animated to show change throughout time. I find trends that change temporally very interesting and would like to learn how to make animations such as above or how to incoporate a sliding bar across time values to allow the reader to interact with the visualization.


### Additional Potential Topics and Exercises for Exploration
I am drawn to particular genres of research. 

List of Humanities Topics:
* topics related to mood (happiness/satisfaction/approval rankings)
* income and its impact across a variety of behaviors (eg. voting, shopping, crime)

*Activity of Interest:* Learning about data visualizations during week three sounds the most appealing to me because it is amazing how raw data can be transformed into an easy-to-comprehend data visualization. Data visualizations helps information become more digestable to those who may be limited in time or resources and is critical for informing the public.

### Potential Investigation Routes for Available Data
Below are potential investigation routes for data that is readily available via the following sources:

* https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php



| Dataset Name        | Description and Investigation Route           | Dataset Link  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| World Values Survey     | Dataset includes social, political, economic, religious and cultural values of people in the world. The data can assess how economic development, democratization, religion, gender equality, social capital, and subjective well-being are related to cultural values. | https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs.jsp |
|  Census Income Data Set      | Dataset includes income data from the Census. It can be used to predict whether income exceeds $50K/yr. Can be combined with another dataset to analyze correlations between economic wellbeing and social unrest. |   https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/ |
|  Geographical Original of Music Data Set  | Instances in this dataset contain audio features extracted from 1059 wave files. The task associated with the data is to predict the geographical origin of music. Can be combined with another dataset to analyze how the origin of music may impact regional listening trends.|    https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00315/ |
