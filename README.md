## Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic upended the lives of nearly every person across the globe. With  mandated goverment shelter-in-places, contested vaccination policies, and overwhelmed medical systems and professionals, 2019-2021 was a challenging time for all countries. Mental health professionals reported record levels of depression and anxiety. To understand the root of discontent, a broad analysis across countries during the pandemic years will be conducted to pinpoint trends, factors, and correlations between world happiness and COVID-19 pandemic severity. The findings are to be used to create a better response to the next global pandemic. 

### Datasets:
